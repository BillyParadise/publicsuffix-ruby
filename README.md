# Public Suffix for Ruby (Extended)


<tt>PublicSuffix</tt> is a Ruby domain name parser based on the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/).

## BillyParadise Additions

Many subdomains (noteably wordpress, livestream, and tumblr) are not included in the basic list.  This fork adds a good hundred or two to the list.  

It's a manual merge at the moment.  If I get any traction for the project which uses this gem, I'll modify it to work directly from two lists.

## Requirements

- Ruby >= 2.0

For an older versions of Ruby use a previous release.
